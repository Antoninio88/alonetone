## Why I built alonetone

alonetone rose out of the core understanding that it costs nothing to immediately share music online.

I wanted to encourage myself and my friends to share what they were working on, in a low-friction and casual way. In the early 2000s, I built music uploading into a forum that a small group of friends and I used.

I imagined a venue where artists could check in on what their friends are up to, get notified when friends upload new music, comment on each other's stuff, etc. Ever the optimistic programmer, I figured with some work, a server, and paying for trivial amounts of bandwidth costs, it was more than possible to open this up to not just my friends, but the world.

Launching in 2008, it clicked with others. A small tight community of musicians uploading and listening to each other was formed.

## alonetone turns out to be social

One of my biggest surprises post-launch was how important the social components of alonetone were. Originally, alonetone was conceived as a way to share, get listened to, and keep up with my artist friends. But with enough activity, people started to spend serious time on the site, socializing and keeping up with what the rest of the community was up to. Despite the comment box on tracks being one-way and simple (I intended for all convo to be around a track), people had elaborate conversations and managed to have all types of social interactions (and drama!).

Socially, things evolved beyond what I originally imagined, or even was setup to handle.

## Sharing The Demo

Back to the music: It's common for musicians to work on things on a day to day basis, and immediately have the impulse to share their cool thing. It's motivating to sketch out ideas and quickly iterate on them, knowing you will share them with others later that night. Musicians know that sometimes songs take months or years, but often they start with a core idea that comes together in mere minutes or an hour. Even with 100s of hours on that same song, the rough and raw demo has a very special quality about it, it captures a creative moment in time, as it happens. It's a musician cliché to

In 2018, musicians use Dropbox and other cloud file sharing services to share demos. They can send it to those couple friends that care and want to keep up.

What's interesting to me, is that at the time of creation of a demo, musicians never know what the future will look like. Maybe this song will be something they spend years polishing, making some super-produced version of it. Maybe this version is all there will ever be. Often they *want* is the same for each song: They want it to be great, they want to put in more work. But they simultaneously excited about its potential and how things *sound* in its current state.

## Releases

Meanwhile, the music industry is based around official releases: Albums, EPs, Singles. Sure, there are some subcultures that treasure The Demo. It's also common for larger musicians and bands to release original demos of songs to their audiences, years and years later.

But releases are what "serious" musicians "should" make: A final product, mixed, mastered, perfect  and signed off on. The reality is that I know many extremely talented music makers who have never officially released things and tend to not have any interest in that. It's high cost and often low reward. Their interest is in exploration, experimentation, in creating proof of concepts...

There's a reason we have releases. Historically, musicians go into studio, record their music, find a label to shoulder costs, and release a physical product. This is extremely high cost and involves a months long time frame.

## Today

The friction around releasing officially has decreased significantly since alonetone started. Bandcamp lets you DIY and start selling immediately. Distrokid lets you distribute to all official stores and immediately be on streaming services. You can be on YouTube instantly, Spotify in hours.

A lot of people are creating "official releases" now, whether it be from their home or project studio. But creating "official" releases in 2018 often still adds weeks or months of latency between "I made this" and "This is ready to listen to." It's high effort, high friction, and high stakes to officially release something. One has to move from "I just made this, should I work on it more?" to "This is the best it's going to get." This makes people pause and can be a lengthly psychological transition.

## Does it Matter?

I wonder whether it's counter productive to draw a strong dark line between official releases and "things I'm working on." Historically it was expensive to share music and getting music out required months of lead time. Now it is not.

Do more polished works have inherently higher value over quick sketches? Do people who tend not to polish work lack a platform to share creativity? Are we discouraging prototyping and creativity in general by only caring about the final marketable product?

All we have to do is look at how people use the tools and what they do. Ableton lets you export to Soundcloud. Soundcloud, due to its blog-like design has been a good platform to share works in progress.

## Alonetone doesn't care?

Alonetone originally aimed to frame "demos" or individual uploaded tracks as equally important to an album. Some folks would only upload in progress work to alonetone. Others would upload only completed work. And others, like myself, would do both.

Is there a benefit to segregating formal releases from demos? Are there two different needs, one to share "this is what i'm working on" and another to say "here is what represents me, my final product"?

It's going to differ on an artist by artist basis. Personally, I want to present my albums without too much social context. Last thing I want is to post share my album to someone and have them be distracted by some argument in the comments. Releases should stand on their own.

 But I also want to upload stuff I'm working on and engage with the community, that is something very valuable.

## Clean album presentation

Alonetone's new presentational album layout only shows the album and its tracks, and shows no social information by default, with the intention that if you are sharing the album elsewhere (twitter, facebook, website), you don't your fans to be smacked over the head with alonetone's social scene — you want them to focus on what you created.
