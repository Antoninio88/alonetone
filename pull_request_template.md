## "Ready For Review" checklist

These checklists are to help the author ensure the code review basics are covered. Feel free to remove to reduce noise on the PR.

* [ ] PR title accurately summarizes changes
* [ ] New tests were added for isolated methods or new endpoints
* [ ] I opened an issue for any logical followups
* [ ] If this fixes a bug, "Fixes #XXX" is either the very first or very last line of the description.

## Before code review *and after additional commits* during review.

* [ ] All tests green
* [ ] Booted up the branch locally, exercised any new code
* [ ] Percy changes are purposeful or explained
* [ ] Css changes are happy on mobile (via Percy is ok)
